## Packages Management

We use two types of software packages: ones needed for the software to work, and ones that make it easier to build the
software. All these are listed in a file named `pyproject.toml`.

### Add a New Dependency

If you need to add a new dependency that's important for the software to work, add it to the `dependencies` list
in `pyproject.toml`. If the dependency is just to help make the software, add it to the `dev` list in
the `optional-dependencies` section.

### Keep Track of Dependencies

We use a tool called `pip-tools` to keep all our dependencies organized. To install it on your computer, type this
command:

```shell
pip install pip-tools
```

You can find a bunch of helpful commands in the `Makefile`, including ones that help manage our dependencies. Here's a
brief overview of them:

- `lock` - locks versions of all dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`. Thanks to the `--upgrade` option, it doesn't
  overwrite already locked dependencies, it just creates new ones.
- `sync` - installs missing dependencies and removes redundant ones.
- `sync-dev` - do the same as `sync`, but also takes into account dev dependencies.

## Code Style

### Formatting

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to automatically format code according
to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). For imports ordering we use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/). Both
tools are configured in `pyproject.toml` to be compatible with each other.

To run them both at the same time and in the correct order, you can use the `fmt` command from the `Makefile`.

To disable formatting for a specific line of code, append `# fmt: skip`
for [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or `# isort: skip` for [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/).
These comments tell the formatters to skip the respective lines. If you want to combine them both into one line,
separate them with a semicolon: `# fmt: skip; isort: skip`.

> **Important:** Always remember to exclude folders/files that do not require formatting. Run the formatter in verbose
> mode to see what it formats.

### Linting

[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is used as the main liner. Its configuration is stored in `pyproject.toml`
using the [Flake8-pyproject](https://pypi.org/project/Flake8-pyproject/) plugin that allows you to do this. Of course,
we use additional plugins to make this tool even more powerful. Here's a brief overview of them:

- [flake8-builtins](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-builtins/) - ensures that variables do not overwrite builtins.
- [pep8-naming](https://pypi.org/project/pep8-naming/) - ensures that [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) naming
  conventions aren't violated.
- [flake8-bugbear](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-bugbear/) - prevents possible bugs and problems.

You can find other
plugins [here](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/awesome-flake8-extensions?tab=readme-ov-file#all-in-one), and if you
find them useful, try integrating them into the project.

We also use [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for static types analysis
and [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for static security analysis. Their configurations you too
can find in `pyproject.toml`.

To run all of them at the same time and in the correct order, you can use the `lint` command from the `Makefile`.

For them, you can also disable checks of specific lines using special comments: use `# noqa` for
[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), `# type: ignore` for [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
and `# nosec` for [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Add these at the end of the line you want the tool
to ignore.

> **Important:** Always remember to exclude folders/files that do not require linting. Run the linter in verbose
> mode to see what it lints.

## Git Hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to set up our git hooks. Right now, we only use `pre-commit` hook for
checking our code’s style before someone commits it. This makes our code reviews easier because we don’t have to worry
about style issues.

### Getting Started

To set up git hooks locally, you just need to run this command:

```shell
pre-commit install
```

If for some reason you need to remove all git hooks from the `.git/hooks` directory, run this command:

```shell
pre-commit uninstall
```

> **Important:** Don't forget to set it up locally as it is a prerequisite. Just do it once and forget about it.

### Configuration

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) framework helps us easily manage and maintain git hooks. It works with many
programming languages, but we mainly use it for Python, which is what it was initially created for.

Our configuration is in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. We are currently
using [local hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#repository-local-hooks), but the real power
of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) is being able to use tools without having to install them on your computer. To
understand more about this, take a look at
this [guide](https://pre-commit.com/#adding-pre-commit-plugins-to-your-project). Also, check out the full list of
available third-party repos with hooks [here](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html).

### Updating Configuration

After updating the configuration you can check if it's valid with this command:

```shell
pre-commit validate-config
```

To update third-party repos with hooks to the latest versions, run this command:

```shell
pre-commit autoupdate
```

And to update a specific one:

```shell
pre-commit autoupdate --repo <repo>
```

### Testing Configuration

You don't need to do a silly commit just to check if the `pre-commi`' hook works. Instead, you can test all hooks with:

```shell
pre-commit run --all_files
```

Or test a specific hook by specifying its id:

```shell
pre-commit run <hook_id> --all_files
```
