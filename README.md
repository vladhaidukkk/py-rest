# SOAP API example with Python

## Packages Management

We use two types of software packages: ones needed for the software to work, and ones that make it easier to build the
software. All these are listed in a file named `pyproject.toml`.

### Add a New Dependency

If you need to add a new dependency that's important for the software to work, add it to the `dependencies` list
in `pyproject.toml`. If the dependency is just to help make the software, add it to the `dev` list in
the `optional-dependencies` section.

### Keep Track of Dependencies

We use a tool called `pip-tools` to keep all our dependencies organized. To install it on your computer, type this
command:

```shell
pip install pip-tools
```

You can find a bunch of helpful commands in the `Makefile`, including ones that help manage our dependencies. Here's a
brief overview of them:

- `lock` - locks versions of all dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`. Thanks to the `--upgrade` option, it doesn't
  overwrite already locked dependencies, it just creates new ones.
- `sync` - installs missing dependencies and removes redundant ones.
- `sync-dev` - do the same as `sync`, but also takes into account dev dependencies.

## Code Style

### Formatting

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to automatically format code according
to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). For imports ordering we use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/). Both
tools are configured in `pyproject.toml` to be compatible with each other.

To run them both at the same time and in the correct order, you can use the `fmt` command from the `Makefile`.

To disable formatting for a specific line of code, append `# fmt: skip`
for [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or `# isort: skip` for [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/).
These comments tell the formatters to skip the respective lines. If you want to combine them both into one line,
separate them with a semicolon: `# fmt: skip; isort: skip`.

### Linting

[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is used as the main liner. Its configuration is stored in `pyproject.toml`
using the [Flake8-pyproject](https://pypi.org/project/Flake8-pyproject/) plugin that allows you to do this. Of course,
we use additional plugins to make this tool even more powerful. Here's a brief overview of them:

- [flake8-builtins](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-builtins/) - ensures that variables do not overwrite builtins.
- [pep8-naming](https://pypi.org/project/pep8-naming/) - ensures that [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) naming
  conventions aren't violated.
- [flake8-bugbear](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-bugbear/) - prevents possible bugs and problems.

You can find other
plugins [here](https://github.com/DmytroLitvinov/awesome-flake8-extensions?tab=readme-ov-file#all-in-one), and if you
find them useful, try integrating them into the project.

We also use [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for static types analysis
and [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for static security analysis. Their configurations you too
can find in `pyproject.toml`.

To run all of them at the same time and in the correct order, you can use the `lint` command from the `Makefile`.

For them, you can also disable checks of specific lines using special comments: use `# noqa` for
[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/), `# type: ignore` for [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
and `# nosec` for [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Add these at the end of the line you want the tool
to ignore.
